# Final-Year-Project
Final Year project for DSP Module

Please read this before cloning or downloading the project. 

# Contents of of the Repo

The repo consists of two main things, the first thing is a folder containing the jupyter notebook that does the dataset analysis and machine learning models, and there is also the csv file used to do this part of the project. The second thing is the folder that contains the mobile application named Spectrum Minds.

# Folder containg Jupyter Notebook

The running jupyter notebook can be seen in the github itself with all the outputs running, so you do not need to run the jupyter file again, but if you want to run it then you need an environment to do so, preferably Jupyter Notebook or VSCode. Please download the the folder where the jupyter notebook is there and make sure that when you run it the csv file is in same folder as the jupyter notebook file. 

Please Note: If for some reason vscode is not supporting the jupyter notebook, then you need to access the jupyter notebook environment through either Anaconda or through the Uni provided website: https://csctcloud.uwe.ac.uk:22000 . After accessing the environment you can then upload the folder in the environment and you will be able to run it. 


# Folder Containg Mobile App

In order to run the Mobile App folder, you need Xcode which is only available on Apple Mac Computers. Once you download that folder you can click the main file which will directly open it in the Xcode if you have it installed. After that you can run the app and it will open on the Xcode Simulator. The image and name of which file to click in order to run the app is below.
